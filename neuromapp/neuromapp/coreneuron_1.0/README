Description of the different files

	- kernel contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about the mechanism execution
	- solver contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about hines solver
	- spike contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about spike exchange
	- common contains file that are common to kernel/spike/solver mini app

From technical point of view, and compilation facilities, every include of the miniapp have the coreneuron_1.0
as root path
