     * The poor man's allocator is a simple pool-based allocator, used to
     * allocate storage for connections in the limit of large machines.
     *
     * The allocator only supports allocation, but no freeing.  In the
     * limit of large machines this is sufficient, because we rarely need
     * to grow synapse lists, as the majority of neurons have at most one
     * target per machine.
     * The allocator manages the pool of free memory in chunks that form a
     * linked list.  A head pointer keeps track of the next position in a
     * chunk to be handed to the caller of allocate. Once head reaches the
     * end of the current chunk, a new chunk is allocated from the OS and
     * appends it to the linked list of chunks.
