Description of the different files

    - kernel contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about the mechanism execution
    - solver contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about hines solver
    - even_passing contains a miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 event exchange and queueing
    - spike contains a specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0 about spike exchange
    - queue contains a wrapping of the MH queue + a simple benchmarks that mimics specific miniapp of coreneuron 1.0
    - cstep contains the combinaison of kernel and solver
    - common contains file that are common to kernel/spike/solver mini app

From technical point of view, and compilation facilities, every include of the miniapp have the coreneuron_1.0
as root path
