Description of files:

    - main.cpp: acts as the interface with the miniapp framework. To run this
        simulation within the miniapp, call "event" followed by the desired
        parameters. Main then runs an MPI application specified by the
        parameters. These applications are described below.

    - event.cpp: the default app modelled after CoreNeuron. It uses classes
        found in the environment, queueing, and spike directories.
        Utilizes the global, blocking Allgather implementation of spike
        exchange.

    - distributed_graph.cpp: Similar to event.cpp, however, the default spike
        exchange implementation has been replaced with one that sets up a
        process topology to create a distributed adjacency graph. This means
        that messages are not sent to the entire global scope, but instead
        only to the nearest neighbor process.
