Subdirectories and brief descriptions:

Environment:
    - Contains classes used to set up the simulation environment.
    These create presyns ( used during spike exchange) and events.

Queueing:
    - Processes events every time step and performs calculations.
    Events are sent to the spike interface, the inter-thread event buffer of the
    destination thread, or are enqueued directly, depending on the event type.

Spike:
    - Handles event exchange between processes. Communicates with
    queueing via the spike interface.

Drivers:
    - Contains the application drivers to execute the program
    within the miniapp framework.
