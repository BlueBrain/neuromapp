Subdirectories and brief descriptions:

Environment:
    - Has two classes used to set up the simulation environment.
    These create presyns and events, respectively.

    Presyns: Contain state information about the interconnects
    between cells. These are used to distribute events.

    Events: Contain a time field and a gid used to reference the
    event's source.

Queueing:
    - Processes events every time step and performs calculations.
    When a new event spikes, the sender may forward the event to
    cells in the same cell group, other cell groups, or both,
    depending on the associated presyn. Finally, all events are sent to
    the spike interface for inter-process communication.

Spike:
    - Handles event exchange between processes. Communicates with
    queueing via the spike interface.

Drivers:
    - Contains the application drivers to execute the program
    within the miniapp framework. May contain multiple drivers for different
    event passing application (for example, currently contains a basic
    "event" app as well as a "distributed graph" app).
