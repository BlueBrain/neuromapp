        \brief Kai's original implementation: generates events according to an exponential law.
	\param beg iterator to the beginning of the vector of queues of events.
	\param simtime total time of simulation (in number of timesteps)
	\param ngroups number of cellgroups per distributed rank
	\param rank distributed rank number
	\param nprocs the total number of distributed ranks in the whole simulation
	\param ncells the total number of cells in the whole simulation
	\param lambda the firing frequency of a single cell (in num events/timestep )

	This implementation generates an event per timestep, and attributes it to a random cell in the network. It then samples a survival interval using an exponential distribution to determine when the next event will occur. This function populates a vector of queues, whose beginning is obtained by the parameter beg. The vector of queues is structured as follows: at position beg + i, we have the queue of events whose source gid belongs to the i^th cellgroup.
	\warning this implementation lacks a biological implementation, since no two events can happen at the same time. This would imply that, in the whole network, only one cell fired at a time .

	\param nprocs the total number of distributed ranks in the whole simulation
	\param ncells the total number of cells in the whole simulation
	\param lambda the firing frequency of a single cell (in num events/timestep )

	This implementation draws, at each timestep, a number of events from a Poisson distribution (see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"> the Wikipedia page</a>). It distributes these events randomly among cells, without keeping memory of the history of each cell. There is no refractory period.
