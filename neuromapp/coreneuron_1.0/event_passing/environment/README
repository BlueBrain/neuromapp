Description of the files:

    - generator.cpp: contains the event_generator class. This creates and
        stores all the spikes that are processed by the queueing part of
        the Miniapp.

    - presyn_maker.cpp: contains the presyn_maker class. This creates and
        stores "presyns" in map structure, alongside a gid key. These presyns
        are simply vectors which contain the destinations to send events
        generated by the cell denoted by their gid.

    Both of these classes offer an API to access the data stored within them.
