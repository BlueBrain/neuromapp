ll_counter: C++ wrappers around low-level CPU and kernel counter facilities.

Functionality is provided under namesapce ll_counter.

linux_perf_count.h:
    Wrapper over a subset of Linux perf functionality.

ll_counter.h:
    Primary interface over counter abstraction:

	ll_counter<counter_type,sync_flags> C;
	C.start();
    
	/* code to benchmark */

        C.stop();
	C::value_type count=C.count();

    ll_counter provides raw counter deltas; ll_timer provides in addition
    times in (double) seconds, where possible.

    ll_op_fence() performs a CPU instruction barrier.
    ll_compiler_fence() provides a compiler reordering barrier.
    busy_wait() does what it says on the tin; used in counter tick
    estimator in ll_timer.
