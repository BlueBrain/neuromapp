Workaround for XL C not including asm comments in generated .s files:

The macros introduce special non-executed code in the functions which
encode the line number where the macros are placed, and also causes
a symbol to be defined in a special section whcih encodes the mapping
between line number and a supplied label.

The postprocess.pl script scans the generated assembly for the
magic marking code, and includes a comment before or after it,
depending on the macro used, with the appropriate label.

demo_kernels.s and demo_kernels.s.post are produced by:

    xlc -O3 -S demo_kernels.c
    perl postprocess.pl demo_kernels.s > demo_kernels.s.post
