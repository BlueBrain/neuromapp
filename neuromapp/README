# Brief description of the directory

* app : contains the main app that organizes all the mini-apps (C++)
* coreneuron_1.0 : contains 3 mini-apps that extract the functionality of CoreNeuron
                ** kernel, the main computation of core neuron (C/OMP)
                ** queueing: contains a simulation of the CoreNeuron queueing functionality (C++)
                ** solver, the famous Hines solver for sparse matrix (C)
* hello: contains a basic example of hello world mini-app (C++)
* iobench: mini-app to test the performance of a key/value store applied to a neuroscience environment (C++)
* keyvalue: mini-app to test the performance of one neuroscience use case with key/value store on BG/Q (C++)
* replib: mini-app that simulates the behavior of Neuron's ReportingLib to write simulation reports (C++)
* spike: contains the spike exchange mini-app (C++)
* synapse: contains a simulation of NEST synapse models (C++)
* utils: a collection of libraries that define common utilities shared by the mini-apps
                ** mpi: contains several MPI utilities, like timer, printing, creating/destroying MPI env, etc.
                ** omp: wrapper to OMP functions. This avoids having ifdef's in mini-app codes to check whether OMP is present or not
                ** storage: a library to handle data loading and sharing between miniapps
