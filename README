The Neuronm(ini)app(lication) provides miniapplications that simulate the
behaviour of neuroscience application. For its first release, the Neuromapp
framework focuses on CoreNeuron application.

The framework is organised under the form

	- neuronmapp/app

This directory neuromapp contains the main program (C++) that organises all the mini
applications. A specific README is added, it gives directives for the plug
of new applications.

	- neuronmapp/coreneuron_1.0

This directory contains miniapps (C)  about the main behaviour of first release
of coreneuron. 3 miniapps are available: kernel, solver and spike

	 kernel: This miniapp extracts the computation kernel of CoreNeuron,
                the miniapp focus on the vectorization by the compiler
        solver: This miniapp extracts the linear algbra solver of CoreNeuron,
                the Hines solver (similar to Thomas Solver for 3 bands matrix)

	 - hello

This directory provides an example of how could be design a miniapp (C++)

        - queuing: T

This miniapp simulates the queueing system of CoreNeuron.
