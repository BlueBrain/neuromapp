Requirements:

- a processor supporting AVX instruction (cat /proc/cpuinfo to check)
- cmake/ccmake
- BOOST, it has been tested with 1.49, 1.54 and 1.55
- cyme: git clone https://username@bbpcode.epfl.ch/code/common/cyme and install into PATH_WHERE_IS_MINIAPP/mini_apps/cyme.
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variables into cyme cmake 

Compiler:

Please use LLVM, (sudo apt-get install llvm, if not install)

Then,

export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++

cd miniapps
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

It will generate two executables:

the original version: 

./original_version/main/main_corebluron 

the cyme version:

./cyme_version/main/main_cyme 

Performance

The cyme version works well with llvm, not well with other compilers (X10 penalites), I have to investigate ...
