\mainpage Neuromapp notice

The purpose of the Neuromapp framework is to reproduce the main functionality  of neuroscience applications.
We are focusing for this first release on the functionality of CoreNeuron 1.0.
The key functionalities of the code has been extracted and code 
in (mini)-application of hundreds of lines. Therefore, everybody who has an interested
on this application can explore it and improve it in a new version. It is the main
point of Neuromapp, propose basement for user and explore new version to improve the
performance.

For his first release the Neuromapp framework supports the "kernel" mini-application that 
reproduces the computation of selected mechanism of CoreNeuron. The "solver" mini-application
that is the implementation of the Hines solver (Similar to the Thomas Solver) and then
"cstep" that mixes the solver and kernel to reproduce a pseudo computation step time.

Moreover the framework provides a tiny memory manager that reproduces the actual
memory scheme of CoreNeuron. We extend a bit the possibility of the memory manager
to allow multiplication run between miniapp without reloading the memory.

To conclude, we also provide a "Hello" project to help the user to implement new miniapp, 
or alternative to the existing one.

\section Definitions

In this section, we give the three main definitions that will be used in the documentation 


\li \c \b skeleton\b, the skeleton is combination of mini-app, due to the large number
of combination mini-app can not really be mixed directly, the developer must create a new mini-app that will interleave the needed mini-app/functions (like the "step" mini-app)

\li \c \b mini-app\b, the mini-app reproduce a key functionality of a application, the 
best example in Neuromapp is the "solver" mini-app, the resolution of a space matrices using the Hines solver. A mini-app can be composed of several kernels. A kernel is limited to hundreds of lines \a e.g.\a the state function of the homonym "kernel" mini-app 

\li \c \b kernel\b, a kernel is the computational part of the mini-app, it can be a solver, a computation routine, \a etc\a â€¦
