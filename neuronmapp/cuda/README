CUDA-related files:
  mechanism/Na.cu: Wrapper functions that call CUDA kernels and __global__ kernel functions.

  mechanism/Na_kernels.cu: Loop implementations, code is shared by both CUDA kernels and CPU verification.

  mechanism/Na.h: Original file, now calls CUDA wrappers and includes additional code to verify the result on CPU.
